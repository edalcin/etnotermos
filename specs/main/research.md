# Research Findings: EtnoTermos Implementation

**Date**: 2025-09-28
**Phase**: 0 - Technical Research
**Status**: Complete

## Technology Stack Decisions

### Backend Framework Choice
**Decision**: Node.js with Express.js
**Rationale**:
- Excellent MongoDB integration with Mongoose ODM
- Strong ecosystem for authentication (Passport.js for Google OAuth)
- Good performance for I/O intensive operations (term searches, relationship queries)
- Docker-friendly deployment
- Active community and enterprise support

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Python/FastAPI: Good for academic applications but Node.js has better real-time capabilities
- Java/Spring Boot: More enterprise-focused, heavier for this use case
- Go: Excellent performance but smaller ecosystem for academic/research tools

### Database Architecture
**Decision**: MongoDB as primary database + Meilisearch for search
**Rationale**:
- MongoDB's document structure ideal for complex term relationships and flexible schemas
- Native support for many-to-many relationships through embedded arrays and references
- JSON-like structure maps well to REST APIs and React frontend
- Meilisearch provides superior full-text search with typo tolerance and multilingual support

**Alternatives Considered**:
- PostgreSQL with full-text search: Relational model less suitable for graph-like term relationships
- Elasticsearch: More complex setup and resource-intensive for 200k terms
- Neo4j: Excellent for relationships but adds complexity for standard CRUD operations

### Authentication & Authorization
**Decision**: Google OAuth 2.0 with JWT tokens
**Rationale**:
- Meets specified requirement for Google login
- JWT tokens enable stateless authentication suitable for API access
- Role-based access control (RBAC) can be implemented with JWT claims
- Supports both web and API authentication flows

**Implementation Pattern**:
- Passport.js GoogleStrategy for OAuth flow
- JWT tokens for session management
- Role hierarchy: Admin > Researcher > Student/Community Leader

### Search Engine Integration
**Decision**: Meilisearch for primary search functionality
**Rationale**:
- Designed for applications with up to millions of documents (well above 200k terms)
- Built-in support for filters, faceted search, and typo tolerance
- Real-time indexing suitable for dynamic term management
- Lightweight deployment compared to Elasticsearch
- Excellent performance for < 1 second search requirement

**Search Architecture**:
- Primary data in MongoDB
- Search indexes in Meilisearch (synced on term creation/update)
- Faceted search by term type, cultural context, time period
- Full-text search across all term fields and notes

### Export Standards Implementation
**Decision**: Node.js libraries for SKOS/RDF generation
**Rationale**:
- `rdf-serialize` for RDF output in multiple formats (Turtle, N-Triples, JSON-LD)
- SKOS ontology mapping for hierarchical term relationships
- Custom CSV export with configurable fields
- Dublin Core metadata integration for academic compliance

**Standards Compliance**:
- SKOS Core vocabulary for concept schemes and term relationships
- Dublin Core for metadata (creator, contributor, date, rights)
- RDF/XML and JSON-LD for semantic web integration
- CSV with RFC 4180 compliance for data analysis

## Cultural Sensitivity Implementation

### Traditional Knowledge Handling
**Research Findings**:
- Follow UNESCO and WIPO guidelines for traditional knowledge documentation
- Implement contributor attribution requirements
- Support for community consent documentation
- Culturally appropriate terminology warnings

**Implementation Approach**:
- Dedicated "Cultural Context" field for each term
- Community contributor attribution system
- Consent documentation workflow
- Cultural review flags for sensitive knowledge

### Multilingual Support
**Decision**: Unicode (UTF-8) with ICU collation
**Rationale**:
- Full support for indigenous language diacritics and special characters
- Proper sorting and comparison for non-Latin scripts
- ICU library for locale-aware string operations
- MongoDB's built-in Unicode support

## Performance Architecture

### Scaling Strategy
**Decision**: Horizontal scaling with read replicas
**Rationale**:
- MongoDB replica sets for read scaling (search-heavy workload)
- Meilisearch clustering if search volume increases
- Node.js cluster mode for CPU utilization
- Docker Swarm or Kubernetes for container orchestration

**Performance Targets**:
- < 1 second for term searches (met by Meilisearch)
- < 500ms for simple term lookups (MongoDB indexes)
- < 5 seconds for complex relationship queries (aggregation pipelines)
- Support for 5-10 concurrent users with room for growth

### Caching Strategy
**Decision**: Redis for session and query caching
**Rationale**:
- Session storage for JWT token management
- Query result caching for expensive relationship calculations
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- Real-time features (future: collaborative editing)

## Security Architecture

### Data Protection
**Research Findings**:
- Academic data requires audit trails and version control
- Private notes need encryption at rest
- API access requires rate limiting and authentication
- Compliance with research data management standards

**Implementation**:
- bcrypt for local password hashing (backup to Google OAuth)
- AES-256 encryption for private notes
- Audit log middleware for all data modifications
- Rate limiting with express-rate-limit
- Input validation with Joi schemas

### API Security
**Decision**: OpenAPI 3.0 specification with security schemas
**Rationale**:
- Clear documentation for external integrators
- Built-in authentication requirements
- Request/response validation
- Rate limiting and quota management per API key

## Academic Standards Integration

### Citation Management
**Decision**: CSL (Citation Style Language) integration
**Rationale**:
- Standard used by academic reference managers (Zotero, Mendeley)
- Support for multiple citation formats (APA, Chicago, etc.)
- JSON-based citation data storage
- Integration with bibliographic databases

**Implementation**:
- citeproc-js for citation formatting
- CSL JSON storage format for bibliographic sources
- DOI resolution and metadata retrieval
- BibTeX import/export support

### Audit and Versioning
**Decision**: Event sourcing for term modifications
**Rationale**:
- Complete audit trail for academic integrity
- Ability to reconstruct term history
- Support for collaborative editing workflows
- Integration with research data management requirements

## Integration Architecture

### API Design
**Decision**: RESTful API with OpenAPI 3.0 documentation
**Rationale**:
- Standard approach for academic system integration
- Clear documentation for researchers and developers
- Support for CRUD operations and complex queries
- Version management for API stability

**API Structure**:
- `/api/v1/terms` - Term management
- `/api/v1/search` - Search functionality
- `/api/v1/export` - Data export endpoints
- `/api/v1/admin` - Administrative functions
- `/api/v1/auth` - Authentication endpoints

### Deployment Strategy
**Decision**: Docker containers with GitHub Actions
**Rationale**:
- Meets requirement for on-demand deployment
- Consistent environment across development and production
- GitHub Actions integration for CI/CD
- Support for both development and production configurations

**Container Architecture**:
- Multi-stage Docker builds for optimization
- Separate containers for backend, frontend, MongoDB, Meilisearch
- Docker Compose for local development
- Production deployment via container registry

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
1. **MongoDB relationship performance**: Mitigated by proper indexing and aggregation optimization
2. **Meilisearch sync complexity**: Handled by event-driven updates and reconciliation jobs
3. **Cultural sensitivity validation**: Addressed by community review workflows and contributor guidelines

### Scalability Risks
1. **200k term limit**: MongoDB can handle millions of documents; Meilisearch scales to 10M+ documents
2. **Concurrent user growth**: Architecture supports horizontal scaling when needed
3. **Export performance**: Implement background jobs for large exports

### Security Risks
1. **API abuse**: Mitigated by rate limiting and authentication
2. **Data integrity**: Addressed by comprehensive audit trails and validation
3. **Traditional knowledge exposure**: Handled by role-based access and cultural sensitivity controls
