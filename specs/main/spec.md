# Feature Specification: Ethnobotanical Terms Database and Management System

**Project**: EtnoTermos

**Created**: 2025-09-28

**Status**: Draft

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-05
- Q: Regarding the "private" note type, who should have permission to view these notes? ‚Üí A: The author and system administrators.
- Q: The spec notes that users will "almost never" edit simultaneously. For the rare case of a conflict (e.g., two users edit the same term), what resolution strategy should be used? ‚Üí A: Attempt to merge and notify.
- Q: FR-012 requires a "visual representation of term relationships." What is the most critical format for this visualization in the first version? ‚Üí A: A 2D interactive graph/network diagram (nodes and edges).
- Q: FR-023 requires "culturally sensitive interfaces." Please provide one specific, actionable example of a feature that would fulfill this requirement. ‚Üí A: Respect principles C.A.R.E.
- Q: FR-025 requires "educational guidance features" for student users. What is the single most important guidance feature to prioritize for the initial release? ‚Üí A: Contextual help and definitions for ethnobotanical concepts.

### Session 2025-10-15
- Q: FR-008 specifies data export in four different formats (SKOS, RDF, Dublin Core, CSV). To ensure value delivery in the first version, which of these formats is the most critical and should be prioritized? ‚Üí A: CSV
- Q: FR-012 specifies a "2D interactive graph". For the first version, what is the most important interaction that the user should be able to perform on this graph? ‚Üí A: Pan/Zoom
- Q: FR-021 mentions "comprehensive API endpoints" for external system integration. Which API paradigm should be prioritized for the initial implementation? ‚Üí A: REST
- Q: The 'Collection' entity is listed in the data model, but its purpose is not detailed. What is the primary function of a "Collection"? ‚Üí A: To act as a simple "tag" for grouping terms thematically (e.g., 'Medicinal Plants').

**Input**: User description: "Quero criar uma base de dados com termos relacionados com o uso de plantas por comunidades tradicionais. Esta base de dados ser√° em MongoDB e seguir√° um esquema de gloss√°rios / vocabul√°rios / tesauro para os termos. Cada termo ser√° relacionado com n outros termos, estabelecendo um grafo das rela√ß√µes entre termos. Cada termo poder√° ter associado √† ele um texto livre (notas), que poder√£o ser \"Nota de escopo\", \"Nota do catalogador\", \"Nota hist√≥rica\", \"Nota bibliogr√°fica\", \"Nota privada\",\"Nota de defini√ß√£o\" e \"Nota de exemplo\". Os termos tamb√©m podem ser classificados como \"meta termo\", \"termo espec√≠fico\", \"termo relacionado\", \"termo gen√©rico\", \"termo preferencial\". As rela√ß√µes entre termos poder√£o ser de \"n\" para \"n\". Este sistema ter√° ainda uma interface moderna e limpa para entrada, edi√ß√£o, dele√ß√£o e busca (CRUD), e garantir√° que termos hierarquicamente relacionados (meta termo -> termo gen√©rico -> termo espec√≠fico) n√£o dever√£o ter seus registros apagados pela interface sem um aviso claro das consequ√™ncias. Este sistema pode ainda usar o Mellisearch para melhorar o desempenho das buscas. Escolha a melhor linguagem para cada funcionalidade do sistema. Este sistema ir√° rodar em um docker, que ser√° disponibilizado por demanda, na execu√ß√£o de um \"action\" no github. O sistema que serviu de inspira√ß√£o para este √© o [TemaTres](https://vocabularyserver.com/web/). Pesquise na Web sobre ferramentas de representa√ß√£o de conhecimento atrav√©s de ontologias, taxonomias, tesauros. glossarios e vocabul√°rios. O controle de acesso ser√° por login com o Google e um administrador ter√° uma interface de administra√ß√£o, onde poder√° definir o tipo espec√≠fico de cada usu√°rio e seus direitos. O sistema ser√° usado por poucas pessoas e quase nunca simultaneamente. O numero de termos deve ficar em torno de 200.000. O sistema deve prever exporta√ß√£o dos dados (termos e suas caracter√≠sticas) em padr√µes abertos e internacionalmente aceitos. As... [truncated]"

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make

2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it

3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item

4. **Common underspecified areas**:

   - User types and permissions

   - Data retention/deletion policies

   - Performance targets and scale

   - Error handling behaviors

   - Integration requirements

   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

As an ethnobotanical researcher, undergraduate/graduate student, or traditional community leader with plant knowledge, I need a comprehensive digital system to catalog, organize, and explore ethnobotanical terminology. The system should allow me to create interconnected vocabularies that reflect the complex relationships between plant terms, usage contexts, and cultural knowledge while providing powerful search and discovery capabilities for research and education purposes. I need secure access through Google authentication, role-appropriate permissions, export capabilities using international standards, and API access for integration with other research systems.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a new ethnobotanical term discovered in field research, **When** I create a term entry with definitions and cultural context plus bibliographic sources, **Then** the system stores the term with all associated metadata, sources, and allows linking to related terms
2. **Given** an existing hierarchical term structure (meta ‚Üí generic ‚Üí specific), **When** I attempt to delete a parent term, **Then** the system warns me about dependent child terms and requires confirmation before proceeding
3. **Given** a collection of terms in the database, **When** I search for a plant name or usage context, **Then** the system returns relevant terms with their relationships and contextual notes displayed clearly
4. **Given** multiple related terms in different categories, **When** I establish many-to-many relationships between them, **Then** the system creates and maintains bidirectional connections that are navigable from either term
5. **Given** a term with multiple note types attached, **When** I view the term details, **Then** all notes (scope, historical, bibliographic, etc.) are organized and presented clearly for reference
6. **Given** I am an administrator, **When** I access the admin interface, **Then** I can manage user roles (researcher, student, community leader), permissions, and view system analytics through a comprehensive dashboard
7. **Given** a collection of terms and their data, **When** I request data export, **Then** the system generates files in internationally accepted open standards (SKOS, RDF, CSV)
8. **Given** I am a new user (researcher, student, or community leader), **When** I attempt to access the system, **Then** I authenticate securely through Google OAuth and receive role-appropriate permissions
9. **Given** I am a community leader with traditional knowledge, **When** I contribute plant usage information, **Then** the system captures this knowledge with proper attribution and cultural sensitivity
10. **Given** an external research system, **When** it requests data through our API, **Then** the system provides secure access to term data based on API authentication and permissions
11. **Given** I am a graduate student conducting research, **When** I need to access specific terminology sets, **Then** the system provides educational-appropriate access with guidance features

### Edge Cases

- What happens when attempting to create circular hierarchical relationships (e.g., term A is parent of B, B is parent of A)?
- How does the system handle bulk deletion of terms that have extensive relationship networks?
- What occurs when searching for terms that contain special characters or diacritical marks common in indigenous language terms?
- How does the system manage conflicting or duplicate term entries from different cultural contexts?
- How does the system perform when approaching the 200,000 term limit?
- What happens when a bibliographic source is referenced by many terms and needs to be updated or deleted?
- How does the system handle Google authentication failures or account changes?
- How are simultaneous edit conflicts handled? The system will attempt to merge changes and notify an administrator if the merge fails.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Term**: Core vocabulary entry representing an ethnobotanical concept with unique identifier, names in multiple languages, definitions, and metadata, linked to sources

- **Note**: Contextual information attached to terms, categorized by type (scope, cataloger, historical, bibliographic, private, definition, example) with timestamps, authorship, and source attribution. "Private" notes are viewable only by their author and system administrators.

- **Relationship**: Connections between terms defining semantic links, hierarchical structures, and cross-references with relationship type classification

- **User**: System actors authenticated through Google OAuth with three primary types: ethnobotanical researchers (full system access), undergraduate/graduate students (educational access with guidance), and traditional community leaders (knowledge contribution focus), each with administrator-defined roles and permissions

- **API**: External system integration endpoints providing secure access to term data, search capabilities, and relationship queries with authentication and rate limiting

- **Source**: Represents the origin of the information, which can be a bibliographic reference (book, article), a herbarium sample, field notes, an interview, etc. The structure will adapt to the source type.

- **Collection**: A simple "tag" used to group terms thematically (e.g., 'Medicinal Plants'). A term can have multiple collections.

- **Role**: User permission templates defining access levels (view, edit, admin) that administrators can assign to users

- **AuditLog**: Historical record of all system changes with user attribution, timestamps, and change details for research integrity

- **UserRole**: Specific permission templates for different user types (Researcher, Student, Community Leader, Administrator) defining access levels and available features

- **APIKey**: Authentication tokens for external systems with defined permissions and usage limits for secure API access
